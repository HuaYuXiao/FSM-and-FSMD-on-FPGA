# FSM-and-FSMD
SUSTech EE332 Digital System Design

Consider the state machine of a sequence recognition shown below. The state machine has 1 input besides the reset and clock signal. The input is a bit-serial input, feeding in a sequence of binary digits.

1. Find out the sequence that the FSM recognizes, and describe the behavior of the FSM.
2. Derive the VHDL code in two-segment coding style for the FSM.

## simulation

Simulate the VHDL model.

### post-synthesis


### post-implementation

If the post-implementation simmulation fails, please increase the time for simulation. This is because in the first 100 ns, something unexpected may happen.
