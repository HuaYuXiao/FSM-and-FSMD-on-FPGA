## state machine

Consider the state machine of a sequence recognition shown below. The state machine has one
input besides the reset and clock signal. The input is a bit-serial input, feeding in a sequence of
binary digits.

1. Find out the sequence that the FSM recognizes, and describe the behavior of the FSM.

2. Derive the VHDL code in two-segment coding style for the FSM.

3. Simulate the VHDL model.

## Fibonacci function

The Fibonacci function is defined as

Implement this function in hardware. Assume that n is a 6-bit input and interpreted as an
unsigned integer. Note that fib(63) is 6557470319842.

1. Derive an algorithm state machine chart.

2. Sketch the conceptual diagram of the FSMD.

3. Develop the VHDL code in two-segment style.

4. Simulate the VHDL model.

5. Analyze the timing of the circuit.

6. Implement this function on the FPGA board. You may design the input/output interfaces.
